# Exercise Tracker

One of the last projects of the hard section of the C# academy

# Features

It's another tracker but incorporates everything learned, EF ORM, SQL server and introduces the repository pattern

* SQL Server
* EF core
* Trackign and saving exercise routines in the database

# Challenges

* The repository pattern was a new concept and took a bit to figure out, but after a bit of reading i was able to grasp it

# What i learned

* With the repository work, i was able to come across and understand dependency injection in C#. I was familiar with the concept from working with angular in the past, but this was a more hands on experience since with angular everything is pretty much done for you. Very cool and very handy
* Solified EF and SQL server concepts really well since with a repository you are forced to integrate them in a more organic manner.
